- 🎓 I have a Technologist degree in Analysis and Systems Development.
- 💡 Currently, I have a large background in Full-stack dev, but if you ask me, I'd rather work with the Front-end side.
- 🔥 My dev career got started in 2012, and I kept going on in this until now.
- 🕹️ I used to be a game dev (you can even find some projects here), but nowadays it is an activity I keep on hiatus.
- 🎨 I also [like to draw](https://luisousarte.tumblr.com/) very much and have a sort of hobbyist career with paintings, illustrations, and frame-by-frame animation.
- 🕴️ Fun fact: I have already taught the _Moonwalk_ to all of my (local) friends.
