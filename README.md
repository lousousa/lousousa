- 🎓 I have a Technologist degree in Analysis and Systems Development.
- 🔥 My dev career got started in 2012, and I've kept at it ever since.
- 💡 Currently, I have a large background in _full-stack_ dev, but if you ask me, I'd rather work with the _front-end_ side.
- 🕹️ Years ago, I used to be a game dev (you can even find some projects here), nowadays, however, it's an activity I keep on hiatus.
- 🎨 I also like to draw and have a sort of [hobbyist career](https://luisousarte.tumblr.com/) with paintings, illustrations, and frame-by-frame animation.
- 🕴️ Fun fact: I have already taught the _Moonwalk_ to all of my (local) friends.
